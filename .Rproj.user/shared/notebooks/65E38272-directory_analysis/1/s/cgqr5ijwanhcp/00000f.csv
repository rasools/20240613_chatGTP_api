"1","The ""diffexp"" section contains the results of differential gene expression analysis for different clustering methods and numbers of clusters. It includes the following subcategories:
- gene_expression_graphclust
- gene_expression_kmeans_10_clusters
- gene_expression_kmeans_2_clusters
- gene_expression_kmeans_3_clusters
- gene_expression_kmeans_4_clusters
- gene_expression_kmeans_5_clusters
- gene_expression_kmeans_6_clusters
- gene_expression_kmeans_7_clusters
- gene_expression_kmeans_8_clusters
- gene_expression_kmeans_9_clusters

Each subcategory likely contains the results of differential gene expression analysis for the respective clustering method and number of clusters specified."
