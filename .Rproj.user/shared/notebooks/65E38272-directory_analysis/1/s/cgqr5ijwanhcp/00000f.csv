"1","The data in the ""raw_internal"" folder seems to contain outputs from an analysis pipeline for gene expression data. Some potential analyses that could be performed on this data include:

1. Clustering Analysis:
   - Gene expression clustering using methods like K-means clustering or graph-based clustering.
  
2. Differential Expression Analysis:
   - Identifying genes that are differentially expressed across different clusters or conditions.
  
3. Dimensionality Reduction:
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the gene expression data.
   - Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for visualizing high-dimensional data in lower dimensions.
  
These analyses can provide insights into the underlying structure of the gene expression data, identify clusters of genes with"

"1","Sure, clustering analysis is a technique used in data analysis to group similar data points together based on certain characteristics or features. In the context of the folder structure and files provided, it looks like there are clustering analysis results under the `clustering` section in the `analysis` folder within the `xenium` project directory.

The clustering analysis results include different clustering methods applied to gene expression data, such as `gene_expression_graphclust`, `gene_expression_kmeans_2_clusters`, `gene_expression_kmeans_3_clusters`, and so on. Each method likely resulted in the creation of different clusters or groups of genes based on their expression patterns.

These clustering results can provide insights into the underlying structure of the gene expression data, identifying potential gene"
